# 🐔 Fluffy-Swizzle Interactive 🎮

Welcome to **Fluffy-Swizzle Interactive** — a collaborative game development hub by two best friends who love building, breaking, and breathing life into fun and creative digital projects.

## 🚀 What We're About

This GitHub organization hosts all the group projects developed by us — **Fluffy** and **Swizzle** — as part of our shared passion for interactive storytelling, *perfectly-imperfect* pixel art, and engaging gameplay mechanics.

Whether it's a jam entry or a long-term project, everything you find here is crafted with care, creativity, and a good dose of chaos (the good kind).
